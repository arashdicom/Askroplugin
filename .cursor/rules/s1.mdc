AskRow Project - The Definitive Master Blueprint (English Version)

Document Version: 3.4 (Comprehensive Admin Dashboard Module)

Goal: To provide site administrators with a single, powerful, and intuitive control center to manage every single aspect of the "AskRow" community. The dashboard must be centralized under one admin menu and offer granular control over all features previously defined.
The guiding philosophy is Total Administrative Control. The site owner must have the power to fine-tune every aspect of the community's economy, rules, and appearance without touching a single line of code. Every feature we have designed for the frontend will be mirrored here with a corresponding set of controls.

Task 1 (Fully Comprehensive): Design and Develop the Unified Admin Dashboard
Description: This task involves creating a top-level admin menu named "AskRow" that houses a multi-tabbed interface. Each tab will be dedicated to a specific area of plugin management, ensuring a logical and uncluttered user experience for the administrator.

Detailed Breakdown of the Admin Dashboard Structure and Tabs:

1.0 Core Admin Interface Architecture

Goal: To create a single, centralized, and logically organized hub for all plugin administration.

1.1. Main Menu Structure

    1.1.1. A single top-level menu item will be created: "AskRow", with a custom SVG icon (e.g., a stylized question mark).

    1.1.2. All plugin-related Custom Post Types (e.g., Questions, Quests) will be programmatically nested as sub-menus under "AskRow" using the 'show_in_menu' argument during their registration. This eliminates all scattered, top-level menus.

1.2. Tabbed Navigation System

    1.2.1. The main "AskRow" admin page will feature a primary, horizontal tab navigation system at the top. The initial tabs will be: Dashboard, Content Management, and Settings.

    1.2.2. The Settings page itself will feature a secondary, vertical sub-tab navigation along the side for its numerous sections. This ensures the interface remains clean and prevents overwhelming the user with too many options at once.

2.0 The "Settings" Tab: General & Layout Controls

Goal: To provide administrators with foundational control over the plugin's integration with their site and its entire visual presentation, including the 70% main content area and the 30% sidebar.

            2.1.1.3. "User Profile" Base Page: A wp_dropdown_pages field to select the base page for user profiles. The plugin will append the username to this page's URL.
